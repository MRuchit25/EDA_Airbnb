We explored data related to Airbnb listings, including the number of properties listed, host characteristics, the variety of amenities available, and the occupancy rate of different properties, among other factors. Further analysis of the data aimed to understand the significance of the reviews left by Airbnb users.\n",

        "Exploratory data analysis projects on Airbnb typically involve investigating patterns and trends in various aspects of the platform, such as pricing, the popularity and availability of listings. This data can be used to gain insights into consumer behavior and preferences, as well as to inform marketing and business strategies for hosts and Airbnb as a company. Techniques such as data visualization and objective solutions may be used to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions.\n",

On the other hand, guests can follow some parameteres to make decisions about the location, amenities, and price of properties they want to book.\n",
